# Hours_Calculator

I work during weekdays after school. I wanted to calculate the amount of hours i worked in the most efficient way possible. 
Previously, I would manually use a calculator to check my hours. This was taking too much time so I decided to make my own calculator that would calculate the hours.
After doing that, I would just multiply the hours by my hourly rate.
